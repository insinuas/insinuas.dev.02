**Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart**[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart#cite_note-1) (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as **Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart**,[\[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart#cite_note-2) was a prolific and influential composer of the [Classical period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_period_(music) "Classical period (music)").

Born in [Salzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Archbishopric_of_Salzburg "Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg"), in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"), Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument "Keyboard instrument") and [violin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin "Violin"), he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known [symphonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_symphonies_by_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart "List of symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"), [concertos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart#Concertos "List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"), and [operas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operas_by_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart "List of operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"), and portions of the [Requiem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_(Mozart) "Requiem (Mozart)"), which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of [his death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart "Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart") have been much mythologized.

He composed more than [600 works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart "List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"), many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of [symphonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony "Symphony"), [concertante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto "Concerto"), [chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music "Chamber music"), [operatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera "Opera"), and [choral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir "Choir") music. He is considered among the greatest [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music "Classical music") composers of all time,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart#cite_note-3)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart#cite_note-4) and his influence on Western music is profound. [Ludwig van Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven "Ludwig van Beethoven") composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and [Joseph Haydn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn "Joseph Haydn") wrote: "posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years".[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart#cite_note-5)
